Problem Statement
Create CNN model classifying cats and dogs. You should take 15 images of cats as input and 15 images of dogs as input.

1. Create a model (from scratch or using transfer learning, anything works)
2. Image manipulation
3. Creating more images for training
4. Improving your models. The tools you used. If you have used CAM (class activation maps) before we'd love for you to try it out.
5. Good explainability on why your model works.
